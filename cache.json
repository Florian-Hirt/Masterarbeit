The promenade can be represented as an infinite line. Initially, you are in the point $$$0$$$ with your dog. You decided to give some freedom to your dog, so you untied her and let her run for a while. Also, you watched what your dog is doing, so you have some writings about how she ran. During the $$$i$$$-th minute, the dog position changed from her previous position by the value $$$a_i$$$ (it means, that the dog ran for $$$a_i$$$ meters during the $$$i$$$-th minute). If $$$a_i$$$ is positive, the dog ran $$$a_i$$$ meters to the right, otherwise (if $$$a_i$$$ is negative) she ran $$$a_i$$$ meters to the left.During some minutes, you were chatting with your friend, so you don't have writings about your dog movement during these minutes. These values $$$a_i$$$ equal zero.You want your dog to return to you after the end of the walk, so the destination point of the dog after $$$n$$$ minutes should be $$$0$$$.Now you are wondering: what is the maximum possible number of different integer points of the line your dog could visit on her way, if you replace every $$$0$$$ with some integer from $$$-k$$$ to $$$k$$$ (and your dog should return to $$$0$$$ after the walk)? The dog visits an integer point if she runs through that point or reaches in it at the end of any minute.

Bob can eat any number of candies from the right (he can't skip candies, he eats them in a row). Of course, if Alice ate a candy, Bob can't eat it (and vice versa).They want to be fair.

There is no better way for them to eat the same total amount of weight.

What is the most number of candies they can eat in total?\n\nInput Specification: The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 2\\cdot10^5$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of candies on the table. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$w_1, w_2, \\dots, w_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq w_i \\leq 10^4$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the weights of candies from left to right. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\\cdot10^5$$$.\n\nOutput Specification: For each test case, print a single integer\u00a0\u2014 the maximum number of candies Alice and Bob can eat in total while satisfying the condition.\n\nNotes: NoteFor the first test case, Alice will eat one candy from the left and Bob will eat one candy from the right. There is no better way for them to eat the same total amount of weight. The answer is $$$2$$$ because they eat two candies in total.For the second test case, Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight $$$7$$$) and Bob will eat the first three candies from the right (with total weight $$$7$$$). They cannot eat more candies since all the candies have been eaten, so the answer is $$$6$$$ (because they eat six candies in total).For the third test case, there is no way Alice and Bob will eat the same non-zero weight so the answer is $$$0$$$.For the fourth test case, Alice will eat candies with weights $$$[7, 3, 20]$$$ and Bob will eat candies with weights $$$[10, 8, 11, 1]$$$, they each eat $$$30$$$ weight. There is no better partition so the answer is $$$7$$$.\n\nCode:\n\ndef read():\r\n    return int(input())\r\n\r\ndef readline():\r\n    return list(map(int,input().split()))\r\n\r\ndef solve():\r\n    n=read()\r\n    arr=readline()\r\n    ans,cur=0,0\r\n    a,suma=-1,0\r\n    b,sumb=n,0\r\n    while True:\r\n        if a>=b: break\r\n        elif suma>sumb:\r\n            b-=1\r\n            sumb+=arr[b]\r\n            cur+=1\r\n        elif ": "2*suma<=sumb:\r\n            a+=1\r\n            suma+=arr[a]\r\n            cur+=1\r\n        else:\r\n            ans=max(ans,cur)\r\n            a+=1\r\n            suma+=arr[a]\r\n            cur=1\r\n    print(ans)\r\n\r\nfor _ in range(read()):\r\n    solve()\n\nThis code reads the input and solves the problem.

A stamp can be rotated, i.e. it can be used in both ways: as $$$\\color{blue}{\\texttt{B}}\\color{red}{\\texttt{R}}$$$ and as $$$\\color{red}{\\texttt{R}}\\color{blue}{\\texttt{B}}$$$.During use, the stamp must completely fit on the given $$$n$$$ cells (it cannot be partially outside the cells). The stamp can be applied multiple times to the same cell. Each usage of the stamp recolors both cells that are under the stamp.For example, one possible sequence of stamps to make the picture $$$\\color{blue}{\\texttt{B}}\\color{red}{\\texttt{R}}\\color{blue}{\\texttt{B}}\\color{blue}{\\texttt{B}}\\texttt{W}$$$ could be $$$\\texttt{WWWWW} \\to \\texttt{WW}\\color{brown}{\\underline{\\color{red}{\\texttt{R}}\\color{blue}{\\texttt{B}}}}\\texttt{W} \\to \\color{brown}{\\underline{\\color{blue}{\\texttt{B}}\\color{red}{\\texttt{R}}}}\\color{red}{\\texttt{R}}\\color{blue}{\\texttt{B}}\\texttt{W} \\to \\color{blue}{\\texttt{B}}\\color{brown}{\\underline{\\color{red}{\\texttt{R}}\\color{blue}{\\texttt{B}}}}\\color{blue}{\\texttt{B}}\\texttt{W}$$$.

In the fifth test case, the sentence $$$s$$$ is $$$\\texttt{BAABBABBAA}$$$, and it's possible that it consists of one word $$$\\texttt{A}$$$, one word $$$\\texttt{B}$$$, two words $$$\\texttt{AB}$$$, and two words $$$\\texttt{BA}$$$, as $$$\\texttt{BA} + \\texttt{AB} + \\texttt{B} + \\texttt{AB} + \\texttt{BA} + \\texttt{A}= \\texttt{BAABBABBAA}$$$.\n\nCode:\n\nfor _ in range(int(input())):\r\n    a,b,ab,ba=map(int,input().split());s=input()\r\n    if s.count('A')!=a+ab+ba:print('NO');continue\r\n    stack=[[1,s[0]]]\r\n    for i in range(1,len(s)):\r\n        if stack[-1][1]!=s[i]:\r\n            x=stack.pop()\r\n            stack.append([x[0]+1,s[i]])\r\n        else: stack.append([1,s[i]])\r\n    stack.sort();trash=0\r\n    for val,ele in stack:\r\n        if not val%2:\r\n            if ele=='A' and ba>=val//2:ba-=(val//2)\r\n            elif ": " ele=='B' and ab>=val//2:ab-=(val//2)\r\n            else:trash+=val//2\r\n    if a+ab+ba>trash:print('YES');else:print('NO')\n\n\nThis python code is solving the problem. The idea is to check if the string can be formed by using the words 'A' and 'B' exactly 'a' times and 'b' times. If it is possible, then it will print 'YES', otherwise 'NO'.\n\nThe code works by first checking if the string",
  "Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem:\n\nDescription: Alina has discovered a weird language, which contains only $$$4$$$ words: $$$\\texttt{A}$$$, $$$\\texttt{B}$$$, $$$\\texttt{AB}$$$, $$$\\texttt{BA}$$$. It also turned out that there are no spaces in this language: a sentence is written by just concatenating its words into a single string.Alina has found one such sentence $$$s$$$ and she is curious: is it possible that it consists of precisely $$$a$$$ words $$$\\texttt{A}$$$, $$$b$$$ words $$$\\texttt{B}$$$, $$$c$$$ words $$$\\texttt{AB}$$$, and $$$d$$$ words $$$\\texttt{BA}$$$?In other words, determine, if it's possible to concatenate these $$$a+b+c+d$$$ words in some order so that the resulting string is $$$s$$$. Each of the $$$a+b+c+d$$$ words must be used exactly once in the concatenation, but you can choose the order in which they are concatenated.\n\nInput Specification: The first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^5$$$) \u2014 the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains four integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, $$$c$$$, $$$d$$$ ($$$0\\le a,b,c,d\\le 2\\cdot 10^5$$$) \u2014 the number of times that words $$$\\texttt{A}$$$, $$$\\texttt{B}$$$, $$$\\texttt{AB}$$$, $$$\\texttt{BA}$$$ respectively must be used in the sentence. The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ ($$$s$$$ consists only of the characters $$$\\texttt{A}$$$ and $$$\\texttt{B}$$$, $$$1\\le |s| \\le 2\\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$|s|=a+b+2c+2d$$$) \u00a0\u2014 the sentence. Notice that the condition $$$|s|=a+b+2c+2d$$$ (here $$$|s|$$$ denotes the length of the string $$$s$$$) is equivalent to the fact that $$$s$$$ is as long as the concatenation of the $$$a+b+c+d$$$ words. The sum of the lengths of $$$s$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$2\\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nOutput Specification: For each test case output $$$\\texttt{YES}$$$ if it is possible that the sentence $$$s$$$ consists of precisely $$$a$$$ words $$$\\texttt{A}$$$, $$$b$$$ words $$$\\texttt{B}$$$, $$$c$$$ words $$$\\texttt{AB}$$$, and $$$d$$$ words $$$\\texttt{BA}$$$, and $$$\\texttt{NO}$$$ otherwise. You can output each letter in any case.\n\nNotes: NoteIn the first test case, the sentence $$$s$$$ is $$$\\texttt{B}$$$. Clearly, it can't consist of a single word $$$\\texttt{A}$$$, so the answer is $$$\\texttt{NO}$$$.In the second test case, the sentence $$$s$$$ is $$$\\texttt{AB}$$$, and it's possible that it consists of a single word $$$\\texttt{AB}$$$, so the answer is $$$\\texttt{YES}$$$.In the third test case, the sentence $$$s$$$ is $$$\\texttt{ABAB}$$$, and it's possible that it consists of one word $$$\\texttt{A}$$$, one word $$$\\texttt{B}$$$, and one word $$$\\texttt{BA}$$$, as $$$\\texttt{A} + \\texttt{BA} + \\texttt{B} = \\texttt{ABAB}$$$.In the fourth test case, the sentence $$$s$$$ is $$$\\texttt{ABAAB}$$$, and it's possible that it consists of one word $$$\\texttt{A}$$$, one word $$$\\texttt{AB}$$$, and one word $$$\\texttt{BA}$$$, as $$$\\texttt{A} + \\texttt{BA} + \\texttt{AB} = \\texttt{ABAAB}$$$.
