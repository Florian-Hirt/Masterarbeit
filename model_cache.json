Since Keshi doesn't know the map of Italy, AmShZ helps him to see each other as soon as possible.In the beginning of each day, AmShZ can send one of the following two messages to Keshi: AmShZ sends the index of one road to Keshi as a blocked road. Then Keshi will understand that he should never use that road and he will remain in his current city for the day. AmShZ tells Keshi to move. Then, Keshi will randomly choose one of the cities reachable from his current city and move there. (city $$$B$$$ is reachable from city $$$A$$$ if there's an out-going road from city $$$A$$$ to city $$$B$$$ which hasn't become blocked yet). If there are no such cities, Keshi will remain in his current city.Note that AmShZ always knows Keshi's current location.

Since Keshi doesn't know the map of Italy, AmShZ helps him to see each other as soon as possible.In the beginning of each day, AmShZ can send one of the following two messages to Keshi: AmShZ sends the index of one road to Keshi as a blocked road.

The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 10^5$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the length of the picture. The second line of each test case contains a string $$$s$$$\u00a0\u2014 the picture you need to make. It is guaranteed that the length of $$$s$$$ is $$$n$$$ and that $$$s$$$ only consists of the characters $$$\\texttt{W}$$$, $$$\\texttt{R}$$$, and $$$\\texttt{B}$$$, representing a white, red, or blue cell, respectively. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.\n\nOutput Specification: Output $$$t$$$ lines, each of which contains the answer to the corresponding test case. As an answer, output \"YES\" if it possible to make the picture using the stamp zero or more times, and \"NO\" otherwise. You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", \"Yes\" and \"YES\" will be recognized as a positive answer).\n\nNotes: NoteThe first test case is explained in the statement.For the second, third, and fourth test cases, it is not possible to stamp a single cell, so the answer is \"NO\".For the fifth test case, you can use the stamp as follows: $$$\\texttt{WWW} \\to \\texttt{W}\\color{brown}{\\underline{\\color{red}{\\texttt{R}}\\color{blue}{\\texttt{B}}}} \\to \\color{brown}{\\underline{\\color{blue}{\\texttt{B}}\\color{red}{\\texttt{R}}}}\\color{blue}{\\texttt{B}}$$$.For the sixth test case, you can use the stamp as follows: $$$\\texttt{WWW} \\to \\texttt{W}\\color{brown}{\\underline{\\color{red}{\\texttt{R}}\\color{blue}{\\texttt{B}}}} \\to \\color{brown}{\\underline{\\color{red}{\\texttt{R}}\\color{blue}{\\texttt{B}}}}\\color{blue}{\\texttt{B}}$$$.For the seventh test case, you don't need to use the stamp at all.\n\nCode:\n\nt = int(input())\r\nAns = [-1]*t\r\nfor z in range(t):\r\n    n = int(input())\r\n    l = input().split('W')\r\n    bad = False\r\n    for s in l:\r\n        b1 = 'R' in s\r\n        b2 = 'B' in s\r\n        if (b1 ^ b2):\r\n        \t<\uff5cfim\u2581hole\uff5c>\r\n    print(\"NO\" if bad else \"YES\")\r\n    \r\n\r\n<\uff5cfim\u2581end\uff5c>": "bad = True\r\n            break\r\n    Ans[z] = \"YES\" if not bad else \"NO\"\r\nfor z in range(t):\r\n    print(Ans[z])\r\n\r\n\r\nThis code will output:\n\nYES\nNO\nYES\nNO\nYES\nNO\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe first test case is explained in the statement.

Jennifer, the social media manager for the event, has arranged them into an $$$n\\times n$$$ square. Being very good at her job, she knows that the contestant standing on the intersection of the $$$i$$$-th row with the $$$j$$$-th column is $$$a_{i,j}$$$ years old. Coincidentally, she notices that no two contestants have the same age, and that everyone is between $$$1$$$ and $$$n^2$$$ years old.Jennifer is planning to have some contestants hold a banner with the ICPC logo parallel to the ground, so that it is clearly visible in the aerial picture. Here are the steps that she is going to follow in order to take the perfect SWERC drone photo.  First of all, Jennifer is going to select four contestants standing on the vertices of an axis-aligned rectangle.  Then, she will have the two younger contestants hold one of the poles, while the two older contestants will hold the other pole.  Finally, she will unfold the banner, using the poles to support its two ends. Obviously, this can only be done if the two poles are parallel and do not cross, as shown in the pictures below.    Being very indecisive, Jennifer would like to try out all possible arrangements for the banner, but she is worried that this may cause the contestants to be late for the competition. How many different ways are there to choose the four contestants holding the poles in order to take a perfect photo?

Straight walls are described by an angle $$$\\theta$$$, the direction of the wall, and two radii $$$r_1 &lt; r_2$$$ describing the beginning and the end of the wall.

Circular walls are described by a radius $$$r$$$, the distance from the center, and two angles $$$\\theta_1, \\theta_2$$$ describing the beginning and the end of the wall in the clockwise direction.

In the fifth test case, the sentence $$$s$$$ is $$$\\texttt{BAABBABBAA}$$$, and it's possible that it consists of one word $$$\\texttt{A}$$$, one word $$$\\texttt{B}$$$, two words $$$\\texttt{AB}$$$, and two words $$$\\texttt{BA}$$$, as $$$\\texttt{BA} + \\texttt{AB} + \\texttt{B} + \\texttt{AB} + \\texttt{BA} + \\texttt{A}= \\texttt{BAABBABBAA}$$$.\n\nCode:\n\nfor _ in range(int(input())):\r\n    a,b,ab,ba=map(int,input().split());s=input()\r\n    if s.count('A')!=a+ab+ba:print('NO');continue\r\n    stack=[[1,s[0]]]\r\n    for i in range(1,len(s)):\r\n        if stack[-1][1]!=s[i]:\r\n            x=stack.pop()\r\n            stack.append([x[0]+1,s[i]])\r\n        else: stack.append([1,s[i]])\r\n    stack.sort();trash=0\r\n    for val,ele in stack:\r\n        if not val%2:\r\n            if ele=='A' and ba>=val//2:ba-=(val//2)\r\n            elif ele=='B' and ab>=val//2:ab-=(val//2)\r\n            else:<\uff5cfim\u2581hole\uff5c>\r\n        else:\r\n            trash+=(val//2)\r\n    print('YES' if trash>=ab+ba else 'NO')<\uff5cfim\u2581end\uff5c>": " trash+=(val//2)\r\n    print('YES' if trash>=ab+ba else 'NO')\n\n\nThe code above is a Python solution for the problem. The code reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the number of times 'A', 'B', 'AB' and 'BA' are used, and the sentence itself. It then checks if it's possible to form the sentence by concatenating these words in some order. If it's possible, it prints 'YES', otherwise 'NO'.\n\nThe code works by first checking if",

It is allowed to increase the price of the good by $$$k$$$ times, with $$$1 \\le k \\le m$$$, k is an integer. Output the roundest possible new price of the good. That is, the one that has the maximum number of zeros at the end.For example, the number 481000 is more round than the number 1000010 (three zeros at the end of 481000 and only one at the end of 1000010).If there are several possible variants, output the one in which the new price is maximal.If it is impossible to get a rounder price, output $$$n \\cdot m$$$ (that is, the maximum possible price).\n\nInput Specification: The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$)\u00a0\u2014the number of test cases in the test.
